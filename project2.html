            <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong> The Page Turner, an assistive device, is being designed to assist individuals with limited mobility by enabling hands-free page turning. Using Arduino-controlled stepper and servo motors, the device aims to provide a reliable solution for turning book pages, allowing users to engage in reading independently. The design incorporates feedback from potential users to ensure it meets functional and accessibility needs.</p>
            <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Design for Accessibility: Develop a mechanism that caters to individuals with varying levels of motor ability, prioritizing ease of use.</li>
                <li>Create a Precision Mechanism: Ensure that the device can handle pages of different thicknesses with gentle, controlled movements.</li>
                <li>Incorporate User Feedback: Focus on a user-centered design to create a practical and effective solution for independent reading.</li>
            </ul>
                <h3>Project Outcomes</h3>
            
            <p>Currently in the design phase, expected outcomes through design phase include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prototype Development: A fully functioning prototype that effectively turns pages using automated controls.</li>
                <li>User Testing and Iteration: Feedback-based improvements to optimize performance, usability, and durability. </li>
                <li>Enhanced Accessibility: A tool that fosters greater independence for individuals with physical limitations, contributing to an improved reading experience</li>
            </ul>
