            <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong> The Occupational Therapy Board is a custom-built therapeutic tool designed for a child with Cerebral Palsy. Developed in partnership with Aaron’s Acres and incorporating feedback from the child’s mother, this wooden cube integrates fine motor skill and cognitive exercises. The board includes four interactive tasks—three focused on motor skills and one on cognitive abilities—enhanced by Arduino-controlled lights that mimic a stoplight, appealing to the child’s love for cars and racing. This gamified approach encourages engagement, making therapy both motivating and enjoyable.</p>
            <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhance Fine Motor Skills: Design hands-on tasks that promote strength, coordination, and dexterity.</li>
                <li>Boost Cognitive Abilities: Incorporate a memory-based activity that challenges the child to recall and replicate patterns.</li>
                <li>Encourage Engagement Through Gamification: Utilize light-up elements and themes based on the child’s interests to make therapy sessions more engaging.</li>
                <li>Incorporate Client and Family Input: Create a customized experience that aligns with therapeutic goals and appeals to the child’s unique preferences and needs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Project Outcomes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Successful Implementation of Therapeutic Tasks: Each motor skill task is linked to an LED indicator through Arduino and photoresistor sensors, reinforcing task completion and adding a visual reward.</li>
                <li>Positive Reception from Stakeholders: The board was featured on local news, with positive feedback from Aaron’s Acres and the child’s family, who observed the child actively engaging with the activities.</li>
                <li>Engagement and Motivation: By aligning the board’s theme with the child’s interests, the project successfully encouraged interaction, making therapy sessions more appealing and enjoyable.</li>
